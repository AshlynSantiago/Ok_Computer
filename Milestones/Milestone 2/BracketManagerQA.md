1)There are other bracket management software, like Challonge Bracket Manager, but they do not unify the brackets into one event.
2)The idea simplifies event management, and helps make sure matches are called in a better order
3)Bracket unification, match prioritizing, and stream integration
4)API's to bring the brackets into the program, a database can be used to store and manage players as entities
5)Match prioritization is the first algorithmic eature, since the program will need to see how important a match is based on the future held up matches, and manual prioritization (such as if a player needs to finish their matches to head out early)
6)I'd rate the initial working feature set (Bracket unification and match priority) at around 7-8
