## **Sprint Retrospective Class Project 2-3-2020**

1. What went well?  
Milestones completed well. Communication whether in person, or on discord went well.

2. What could have gone better?  
Needed more set responsibilities for each member. Basing things off examples to save time of rewriting wrong formats. Focus getting our deadlines finalized. 

3. Specific recommendations for the next Sprint.  
Stop procrastinating. Need to standardize our coding habits/styles. Get concrete meeting times determined. More visualization of our team project.
