Group Project Q/A - Ok Computer



Questions:
1. What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)

2. Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?

3. What are a few major features?

4. What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.

5. What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)

6. Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.


Answers:



1. There are a few resources available for people planning tours, most notably indieonthemove.com which is also seems to be an asp.net web app, however it misses many smaller venues. Largely booking today for independent musicians is done via facebook. People mostly seem to network manually and directly with connections they have made personally. Public facebook groups often play a major role in finding information about what sort of performance art occurs in a given city. While this works, all of the leg work of planning still falls on the musician.

2. This idea will relieve some of the stress associated in planning a prolonged road trip with planned stops in specific areas on specific dates. Without any familiarity with a region, the user is immediately returned a list of viable venues, as well as some information about them, including their contact information. This idea is significant because it reduces the amount of work required by musicians in coordinating tour plans, they aren’t experts in booking, or travel planning, so it lets the user focus on their strengths rather than worrying about logistics.

3. 
-venues listed by region
-tour planning tool which returns a list of stops between two destinations
-google maps route output


4. This project would require the use of two APIs, the first and foremost would be one which contains information about music venues across the world, I currently have my eye on songkick, but other viable options include bandsintown, brownpapertickets, and numerous other performance art related APIs. An important consideration in this project is whether or not smaller venues appear in these APIs, from a users standpoint if the program largely returns big concert halls and stadiums, that’s not very useful to the user as this is focused on independent musicians which are not likely to be able to fill a stadium.

5. The algorithmic component of this program would be the tour planning tool. It takes a start point, and an endpoint, and determines stops to make on the way. Certain parameters would be adjustable by the user in order to taylor the output of the algorithm to their specific needs and wishes. For example, say you want to get across the country fast, so you set your minimum drive distance to 400 miles, so that you have full days of driving in between your shows.

6. I would say a 4 or 5. While the project could expand to be more difficult and complex, the base line is that this project doesn’t involve many tools we aren’t already familiar with. The bulk of the new material is within the google maps API.
