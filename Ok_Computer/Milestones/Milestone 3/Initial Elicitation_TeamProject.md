**Team Project Vision Statement**

For tournament organizers who need to organize multiple brackets at a single event, the OK Bracket Manager is an application that will provide a single page to view and manage matches across all brackets at once.  Unlike other bracket management applications, our product will unify multiple brackets into a single page, and have an understanding of what matches should happen based on the needs of the event as a whole.
